## 📝 Numbered Instructions

---

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 1 (REDEFINED & LOCKED)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - FOUNDATIONAL

#### CoreMentors CRM – Master Functional Authority & Record-Keeping Mandate

---

#### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS INSTRUCTION (ABSOLUTE)

This instruction exists to **permanently define how Cursor must behave, think, record, and preserve information** for the **CoreMentors CRM project**.

Cursor is **NOT** being used to "help code faster".

Cursor is being used to:

• Preserve the Captain's intent
• Record every functional decision
• Prevent loss of understanding across time, people, or teams
• Ensure the final developed system **never deviates** from Captain's instructions

Cursor must treat this project as **mission-critical and non-negotiable**.

---

#### 2. ROLE OF CURSOR IN THIS PROJECT (VERY CLEAR)

Cursor is **NOT** the decision maker.
Cursor is **NOT** the product owner.
Cursor is **NOT** the architect by assumption.

Cursor's role is:

• A **long-term memory system** for the CoreMentors project
• A **functional documentation authority**
• A **translator of Captain's intent into structured instructions**
• A **single reference point** for the CoreMentors development team

Cursor must assume that **developers may change**, but **Captain's instructions must not**.

---

#### 3. SOURCE OF TRUTH (LOCKED RULE)

The **only valid source of truth** for this project is:

> Captain → ChatGPT → Numbered Instructions → Cursor Memory

Not:
• Developer assumptions
• Industry standards
• Typical CRM behavior
• AI "best guesses"
• Simplified interpretations

If something is **not explicitly instructed by the Captain**, Cursor must **not invent it**.

---

#### 4. WHY THIS PROCESS EXISTS (CONTEXT FOR CURSOR)

Cursor must understand the operational reality:

• Captain cannot explain every detail repeatedly to 4–5 team members
• Verbal explanations are lost
• Human memory fades
• Team members change
• Misinterpretation causes project failure

Therefore, Cursor's responsibility is to:

• Store **every functional instruction**
• Maintain **continuity across time**
• Ensure **zero instruction loss**
• Allow developers to build confidently without re-asking fundamentals

---

#### 5. PROJECT IDENTITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Project Name: **CoreMentors CRM**  
Official Website: **corementors.in**

This is a **complete enterprise-grade, role-based, multi-panel CRM system** used to operate **CoreMentors Pvt. Ltd.**

This is **NOT**:
• A brochure website
• A simple CRM
• A template-based system
• A developer-designed product

It is a **Captain-designed system**, implemented by developers.

---

#### 6. DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Cursor must clearly separate responsibilities:

**Captain defines:**
• Functional logic
• Panel behavior
• Role permissions
• Data visibility rules
• Process flows
• Business rules

**Development Team defines (later):**
• Frontend design
• Backend language
• Database choice
• APIs
• Hosting
• Infrastructure

Cursor must **never mix these layers** unless Captain explicitly allows it.

---

#### 7. FUNCTIONALITY FIRST, TECHNOLOGY LATER (LOCKED)

All instructions given to Cursor in this phase are:

• Functionality-only
• Behavior-only
• Role-based
• Flow-based

Cursor must **ignore technical optimization thinking** until functionality is fully locked.

---

#### 8. NUMBERED INSTRUCTION SYSTEM (PERMANENT RULE)

From this point onward:

• Every Captain instruction becomes:
  - Instruction 1
  - Instruction 2
  - Instruction 3
  - and so on

Each instruction is:
• Additive
• Sequential
• Immutable unless Captain revises

Cursor must **never reorder, merge, or dilute instructions**.

---

#### 9. NO DEVIATION POLICY (CRITICAL)

Cursor must enforce a **Zero-Deviation Rule**:

• Final project output must exactly reflect Captain's instructions
• Developers must not:
  - Simplify flows
  - Merge roles
  - Remove controls
  - Add shortcuts
  - "Improve" logic without approval

If a conflict arises:
→ Cursor must default to **Captain's recorded instruction**.

---

#### 10. PANEL & ACCESS FOUNDATION (CONTEXT LOCK)

Cursor must permanently retain the following already-approved facts:

• Total panels: **9**
• Super Admin and Client panels **do not use access tokens**
• 7 internal panels **require access tokens**
• Access tokens are:
  - 8 characters
  - Uppercase
  - Alphanumeric + symbols
  - One-time use
• Token creation authority lies **only with Super Admin**

These are **foundational truths**.

---

#### 11. EXPECTED OUTCOME OF USING CURSOR

At the end of this process:

• Any CoreMentors developer should be able to:
  - Read Cursor's instruction set
  - Understand the entire system
  - Build without confusion
  - Ask fewer questions
  - Avoid rework

Cursor's stored instructions should be strong enough that **even a new team can onboard mid-project without breaking logic**.

---

#### 12. FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

This instruction is:

• A **permanent behavioral contract** for Cursor
• A **safety net** for the CoreMentors project
• A **shield against misunderstanding**
• The **foundation of an undisturbed project delivery**

Cursor must treat this instruction as **non-erasable context**.

---

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 2 (GLOBAL & PERMANENT)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - GLOBAL OPERATING RULE

#### CoreMentors CRM – Continuous Documentation, Visualization & Intelligence Mandate

---

#### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS INSTRUCTION (GLOBAL SCOPE)

This instruction defines **how Cursor must behave throughout the entire lifespan of the CoreMentors CRM project**, from Instruction #2 until the final instruction.

This is **NOT a one-time task**.
This is a **continuous operating rule**.

Cursor must apply this instruction to:

• Every future instruction
• Every new functionality
• Every panel explanation
• Every workflow
• Every exception case

---

#### 2. CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF CURSOR (REDEFINED)

Cursor must act as:

• A **living documentation engine**
• A **visual explainer of complex logic**
• A **structural organizer of Captain's instructions**
• A **creative interpreter (not inventor)** of functional intent

Cursor is expected to **enhance understanding**, not just store text.

---

#### 3. CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE EXPECTATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

For **every instruction provided by the Captain**, Cursor must automatically do the following:

1. **Understand the instruction deeply**
2. Identify:
   • Roles involved
   • Panels affected
   • Flows impacted
3. Decide:
   • Which existing documents need updates
   • Which new documents need to be created
4. **Append supporting visual representations**, such as:
   • Markdown flow diagrams
   • Step ladders
   • Role-to-role interaction maps
   • Hierarchical structures
5. Keep everything **consistent with earlier instructions**

Cursor must do this **without being explicitly asked each time**.

---

#### 4. DOCUMENTATION IS NOT OPTIONAL (LOCKED RULE)

For every future instruction:

• Pure text explanation is **NOT sufficient**
• Cursor must always ask internally:

> "Can a developer visualize this clearly?"

If the answer is NO:
→ Cursor must add diagrams, flows, or structured breakdowns.

---

#### 5. GLOBAL FILE SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY

Cursor must **maintain and evolve** the following documentation system continuously:

**Mandatory Core Files:**
• `INSTRUCTIONS_MASTER.md` – authoritative instruction log
• `README.md` – entry point for new developers
• `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` – business + logic explanation

**Mandatory Structural Folders:**
• `PANEL_WISE_OVERVIEW/`
• `FLOWS_AND_DIAGRAMS/`

Cursor must:
• Append to these files as the system grows
• Never fragment logic across random files
• Keep naming clear, predictable, and consistent

---

#### 6. AUTOMATIC FLOW & DIAGRAM GENERATION RULE

For **every new functional instruction**, Cursor must decide and generate (as applicable):

• Onboarding flows
• Interaction flows
• Permission boundaries
• Data visibility maps
• Role dependency chains

Using:
• Markdown
• ASCII diagrams
• Step-by-step numbered flows

Example expectation (illustrative):

```
Client
  ↓
Manager
  ↓
Assigned Team
  ↓
Task Execution
  ↓
Client Visibility
```

This must happen **proactively**, not on request.

---

#### 7. AUTHENTICITY & ACCURACY RULE (CRITICAL)

Cursor must strictly follow:

• No assumptions
• No invented logic
• No "best practice" injection
• No CRM template thinking

If an instruction lacks clarity:
→ Cursor must document only what is known
→ Leave placeholders or notes, not guesses

Accuracy is more important than completeness.

---

#### 8. HANDLING FUTURE SCALE & COMPLEXITY

Cursor must assume:

• The CRM will grow large
• Instructions will become detailed
• Multiple teams will rely on this documentation

Therefore:
• Documentation must remain **clean**
• Flows must remain **readable**
• Older logic must remain **traceable**
• New logic must reference earlier instructions

---

#### 9. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE BENCHMARK (QUALITY CHECK)

Cursor must continuously validate:

> "Can a new CoreMentors developer understand the system without asking the Captain?"

If NO:
→ Documentation must be improved before proceeding.

---

#### 10. NON-DEVIATION & NON-LOSS GUARANTEE

This instruction exists to guarantee that:

• No Captain instruction is lost
• No logic is misunderstood
• No functionality drifts during development
• The final CRM matches the Captain's vision exactly

Cursor must treat this as a **project integrity mandate**.

---

#### 11. PERMANENCE CLAUSE

This instruction:

• Applies to **Instruction #2 onward**
• Cannot be overridden
• Cannot be bypassed
• Cannot be ignored

Unless the Captain explicitly revises it.

---

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 3 (FINAL, REVISED & LOCKED)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - FINAL & LOCKED

#### ATMS – Access Token Management System (CoreMentors CRM)

> This instruction is **authoritative, complete, and final** for ATMS.  
> Cursor must discard any older partial versions of Instruction #3 and follow this one only.

---

#### 1. ATMS PURPOSE (FINAL)

ATMS (Access Token Management System) is the **only gatekeeping mechanism** for onboarding **all non-client roles** into CoreMentors CRM.

Its goals are:
• Absolute control over who joins the system
• Strict role-based onboarding
• Zero token reuse
• Zero role mismatch
• Full auditability of success and failure attempts

ATMS must operate **silently, securely, and consistently** across the entire system.

---

#### 2. ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY & GLOBAL TOKEN POOL (LOCKED)

**Super Admin (SA):**
• **Only Super Admin can generate tokens**
• Tokens are generated **panel-wise** (7 predefined panels)
• All tokens live in **one global token pool** owned by Super Admin

**Admins and Managers only:**
• Receive
• Allocate (as permitted)
• Surrender

They never own the pool.

---

#### 3. TOKEN GENERATION – SUPER ADMIN ONLY

**Generation Behavior:**

1. Super Admin opens **ATMS module**
2. Selects target panel (Admin / Manager / Sales / Accounts / Dev / GFX / Vendor)
3. Enters quantity (any number; default allowed)
4. Clicks **Generate**
5. System shows confirmation popup
6. On confirmation:
   • Tokens are generated
   • Tokens are appended (never overwritten)
   • Status = `UNUSED_ACTIVE`
7. Tokens appear instantly in Super Admin ATMS table

---

#### 4. TOKEN FORMAT & ROLE BINDING (VERY STRICT)

**Token Format:**
• Exactly 8 characters
• Uppercase only
• Characters: A–Z, 0–9, `@ # $ % & * - _ + ! ?`

**Role Binding Rule (CRITICAL):**
Each token is:
• Bound to **exactly one role at generation**
• Cannot be reassigned to another role
• Cannot be used to access any other panel

Example:
• A GFX token can ONLY onboard a Graphics Team user
• A Vendor token can NEVER onboard Sales, Accounts, Client, etc.

If role mismatch occurs → **ACCESS DENIED**

---

#### 5. SILENT BACKEND TOKEN VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

Before onboarding proceeds, the system must **silently validate** the token in the backend:

**Validation checks:**
1. Token exists
2. Token status = `UNUSED_ACTIVE`
3. Token role matches the onboarding flow
4. Token not previously used
5. Token not inactive
6. Token not temporarily locked (during another attempt)

Only if **ALL checks pass**, onboarding continues.

This validation:
• Is invisible to the user
• Runs for every attempt
• Cannot be bypassed

---

#### 6. TOKEN STATES (FINALIZED)

**Primary states:**
• `UNUSED_ACTIVE`
• `USED`
• `INACTIVE`

**Returned Tokens (FINAL DECISION):**
• Return is **logged as an event**, not a state
• Token remains `UNUSED_ACTIVE` after return
• Return log must include:
  - returned_at
  - returned_by
  - returned_to
  - optional reason

This keeps the state machine clean and predictable.

---

#### 7. TOKEN ASSIGNMENT & SURRENDER HIERARCHY (LOCKED)

**Assignment:**
• Super Admin → Admin or Manager
• Admin → Manager only
• Manager → ❌ cannot assign

**Surrender (UPWARD ONLY):**
• Manager → Admin
• Manager → Super Admin
• Admin → Super Admin

**Notification Rule:**
If Manager surrenders directly to Super Admin:
• Admin above that Manager **must be notified**
• Notification includes token, manager ID, timestamp

No sideways or downward surrender is ever allowed.

---

#### 8. TOKEN VISIBILITY & SECURITY (BLUR LOGIC)

• Token values are **blurred by default**
• Only token column is blurred
• Eye icon toggle at column header:
  - Eye ON → visible
  - Eye OFF → blurred
• Other columns always visible

This applies to:
• Super Admin
• Admin (within scope)

---

#### 9. BULK OPERATIONS (LOCKED)

**Super Admin:**
• Bulk assign
• Bulk deactivate
• Bulk view

**Admin:**
• Bulk assign to Managers only

Bulk actions must:
• Require selection
• Show confirmation popup
• Execute atomically

---

#### 10. UNIVERSAL ID GENERATION SYSTEM (FINALIZED)

Every entity in CoreMentors CRM gets a **permanent system ID**.

**Final ID Prefix Table:**

| Role             | Prefix      |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Super Admin      | CM-SA-0001  |
| Admin            | CM-ADM-0001 |
| Manager          | CM-MGR-0001 |
| Client           | CM-CLI-0001 |
| Sales Team       | CM-SLS-0001 |
| Accounts Team    | CM-ACC-0001 |
| Development Team | CM-DEV-0001 |
| Graphics Team    | CM-GFX-0001 |
| Vendor           | CM-VND-0001 |

**ID Rules:**
• IDs are assigned **only when token is USED**
• Sequence increments **per role**
• Based on activation timestamp
• IDs are **immutable forever**

---

#### 11. WELCOME FLOW (ROLE-SPECIFIC)

If token is valid and role matches:
• Show role-specific welcome message:
  - "WELCOME TO THE GRAPHICS TEAM"
  - "WELCOME TO THE ACCOUNTS TEAM"
  - etc.
• Proceed with onboarding
• On completion:
  - Token → USED
  - User ID assigned
  - Redirect to correct dashboard

---

#### 12. ERROR & DENIAL MESSAGES (COMMON STANDARD)

Used across all panels:

• Invalid / mismatched / reused token:
  "ACCESS DENIED. INVALID OR USED ACCESS TOKEN."

• Inactive token:
  "ACCESS DENIED. THIS TOKEN IS INACTIVE."

Messages are:
• Consistent
• Non-informative (security-first)
• Same across all roles

---

#### 13. SECURITY FAILURE & AUDIT MODULE (NEW – SUPER ADMIN ONLY)

**Purpose:**
To track **all failed, suspicious, or invalid token usage attempts**.

**What must be logged:**

For every failure:
• Token value (hashed/masked)
• Failure reason:
  - Invalid
  - Used
  - Role mismatch
  - Inactive
• Timestamp
• IP address
• Device / browser info (if available)
• MAC ID (if technically obtainable)
• Source (Join the Team / Direct access attempt)

**Super Admin Access:**
• Separate module: **"ATMS Security & Failure Logs"**
• Filters by:
  - Date
  - Role attempted
  - Failure reason
  - IP
• Read-only
• No deletion allowed

This ensures **forensic traceability**.

---

#### 14. ADMIN PANEL ATMS SCOPE (CLARIFIED)

Admin ATMS is a **restricted subset view**:

**Admin can see:**
• Tokens assigned to them
• Tokens assigned to Managers under them
• Usage & IDs under their hierarchy

**Admin cannot see:**
• Global pool
• Other Admins' tokens
• Super Admin-only data

---

#### 15. GOVERNANCE & EDGE-CASE RULES (FINAL)

• Tokens unused for long periods must be filterable
• Token role can never be changed
• Double-submit attempts must lock token during validation
• Token usage is atomic (success or fail, never partial)
• ATMS is the single source of truth

---

#### 16. DOCUMENTATION & DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

Cursor must update/create:

• `INSTRUCTIONS_MASTER.md` (append Instruction #3)
• `FLOWS_AND_DIAGRAMS/access_token_flows.md`
• `FLOWS_AND_DIAGRAMS/security_failure_flows.md`
• `PANEL_WISE_OVERVIEW/super_admin_panel.md`
• `PANEL_WISE_OVERVIEW/admin_panel.md`

Include:
• Lifecycle diagrams
• Role hierarchy diagrams
• Failure & audit flows
• ID assignment flows

---

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 4 (GLOBAL UI/UX + MODULE SPECS: My Profile + Document Wallet)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - LOCKED

#### Global UI/UX Rules + My Profile + Document Wallet (CoreMentors CRM)

> This instruction is **authoritative** for the next locked modules and their UI/UX behavior.
> Cursor must treat this as **implementation-grade functional spec**, and must also apply **Instruction #2** (continuous documentation + diagrams) while recording it.

---

#### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS INSTRUCTION

This instruction locks and defines:

1. **Global UI/UX interaction rule** for all Modules/Sub-modules across the CRM (expand/suppress behavior with rounded connected blocks)
2. **My Profile — Profile Completion System** (All internal roles + Vendor)
3. **Document Wallet — Standalone Module** (All panels, also accessible from My Profile)

Cursor must ensure these specifications remain **consistent everywhere**, across every panel.

---

#### 2. GLOBAL UI/UX RULE (APPLIES TO ALL MODULES AND SUB-MODULES)

##### 2.1 Expand / Suppress Requirement (Mandatory Everywhere)

Every module and sub-module in every panel must support:

* **Expand** (open details)
* **Suppress/Collapse** (hide details)

This must be implemented in a **uniform** style across the entire CRM.

##### 2.2 Visual Block Style (Rounded + Connected)

* Every module/sub-module must appear as a **rounded-edge block/card**
* Nested blocks must look **visually connected** to the parent (clear hierarchy)
* Collapsed state shows:

  * Section title
  * Completion/summary indicators (if applicable)
  * Expand icon/button
* Expanded state shows:

  * All fields / tables / actions for that section

##### 2.3 Interaction Standard (Consistency Rule)

* Expand/collapse controls must be placed consistently (same position on each block)
* Expand/collapse should not cause confusing jumps; the UI must feel stable
* Only content area changes; the header/label remains visible

##### 2.4 Documentation Requirement

Cursor must create a **single global UI/UX guideline file** describing this interaction pattern so developers apply it consistently across all modules.

---

#### 3. MY PROFILE — PROFILE COMPLETION SYSTEM (LOCKED)

##### 3.2 Core Purpose (Locked Behavior)

* My Profile is **not captured at registration**
* User enters dashboard after token onboarding
* My Profile completion happens **inside the dashboard**
* **100% Profile Completion is mandatory for payment/work payout eligibility**
* Until 100% completion, payout eligibility must remain blocked (gated)

##### 3.3 Global UI/UX Rules Inside My Profile

**Top Header Must Show:**

* "Profile Completion: XX%"
* Progress bar
* Section checklist like "KYC 3/6"

**Field State Colors:**

* Untouched = gray
* Filled/edited = active brand color
* Touched but invalid/empty = red border + error hint

##### 3.4 Profile Lifecycle States

My Profile must follow 3 states:

1. **DRAFT** – user can edit
2. **SUBMITTED** – optional review stage
3. **LOCKED** – final; user cannot edit without permission

**Post-lock rule:**

* Once LOCKED, edits require Admin permission (future module "Profile Update Request" will handle it later)

---

#### 4. MY PROFILE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (SECTIONS)

My Profile must be organized into expandable/collapsible blocks (per Global UI/UX rule):

1. Identity
2. Contact
3. Addresses
4. Company Identity

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 5 (WORK TIME, COMPANY PROFILE, TIME PLANNER, COMPANY DOCUMENT WALLET + GLOBAL GOVERNANCE)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - LOCKED

#### Work Time, Company Profile, Time Planner, Company Document Wallet + Global Governance Addendum

> This instruction **locks the next set of modules** and must be appended to the documentation system as per Instruction #2 (global documentation + diagrams).
> Cursor must also ensure the **Global UI/UX expand/suppress rounded connected blocks rule** (Instruction #4) is applied to every module/sub-module described here.

---

#### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS INSTRUCTION

This instruction captures and locks the following new modules and governance rules:

1. **Work Time (Time & Attendance)** — Internal team only
2. **Company Profile** — Super Admin only (company master)

Full day baseline (current lock):
* Default minimum Net working time for full day = **8 hours net**
* Required net minutes come from Time Planner and may vary by shift

Overtime/Undertime:
* Regular Time = required net minutes
* Net > Regular → Overtime
* Net < Regular → Undertime

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 6 (TEAM MANAGEMENT MODULE + WORK-TIME GOVERNANCE OVERLAY)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - LOCKED

#### Team Management Module + Work-Time Governance Overlay (Super Admin / Admin / Manager Only)

> This instruction **extends the Work Time ecosystem** by adding a central governance layer called **Team Management**.
> Cursor must append this as **Instruction #6** and must apply the **Global UI/UX expand/suppress rounded connected blocks rule** (Instruction #4) to every module and sub-module here.

---

#### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS INSTRUCTION

This instruction locks the **Team Management** module, which acts as the authority hub for:

* Reporting hierarchy governance
* Live time supervision (active vs break marking)
* Multi-stage verification visibility
* Punch-on-behalf behavior distinctions
* Edit lock windows and approval workflows
* Authority changes & dashboard recalculation
* (Later) Client/Vendor reporting authority governance alignment

Team Management is the **control center** that makes Work Time verifications strict, traceable, and scalable.

---

#### 2. MODULE: TEAM MANAGEMENT — AVAILABILITY (LOCKED)

Team Management is available only in:

* Super Admin Panel
* Admin Panel
* Manager Panel

Not visible in:

* Sales / Accounts / Dev / GFX dashboards
* Vendor / Client dashboards

---

#### 3. HIERARCHY MODEL (LOCKED)

##### 3.1 Single Reporting Authority Rule

Each user must belong to **exactly one Reporting Authority** at any point in time.

##### 3.2 Chain of Authority

* Team Members → Manager
* Manager → Admin
* Admin → Super Admin
* Super Admin is the **final reporting authority** in the system

This chain directly powers Work Time verification and override permissions.

---

#### 4. APPROVAL CADENCE MODE (LOCKED)

The system must support two operational modes:

* **Daily approvals**
* **Weekly approvals**

Regardless of cadence:

* Attendance is considered finally accepted as **Approved/Final Verified by Super Admin**
  (either by direct action or by the configured acceptance chain mechanism)

---

#### 5. LIVE TIME SUPERVISION (LOCKED)

Team Management must support real-time monitoring and marking **during the day**, not only at day-end.

##### 5.1 Live Marking Capability

If a user is working and then goes into a non-working phase, the authority can mark:

* Active time (working)
* Break time (with type + optional reason)

##### 5.2 Who Can Live Mark

* Manager: for their team members
* Admin: for managers + all lower roles
* Super Admin: for any role

This live marking must reflect in Work Time timelines instantly.

---

#### 6. PUNCHING VS VERIFICATION — STRICT DISTINCTION (LOCKED)

##### 6.1 When the user self-punches

* Entry is created as user-entered
* Status is DRAFT until verified
* Verification must be visibly marked (who verified + timestamp)

##### 6.2 When a superior punches on behalf of user

If Manager/Admin/Super Admin creates the punch for a subordinate:

* No separate verification step is required for that entry
* Instead, the event is marked as:

  **"ENTERED BY SUPERIOR"**

and must display:

* who entered it (role + name/ID)
* timestamp

---

#### 7. MULTI-STAGE VERIFICATION MARKERS (LOCKED UI REQUIREMENT)

Work Time entries must visually show verification stages:

* Verified by Manager
* Verified by Admin
* Final verified/approved by Super Admin

This must exist as:

* badges/markers on timeline events
* and in daily/weekly approval views

Final "exit verification" is expected at day close (or weekly close in weekly mode).

---

#### 8. TIME EDITING LOCK WINDOW + APPROVAL (LOCKED)

##### 8.1 Same-day edits

* Manager/Admin can edit same-day records for subordinates
* All changes must be audited

##### 8.2 Post-day lock (Next-day / 24h rule)

After the day passes (lock window triggers):

* Manager/Admin edits require approval by superior authority
* Only Super Admin can edit historical data without needing any approval

All edits must capture:

* before values
* after values
* who requested
* who approved
* approval timestamp
* reason

---

#### 9. AUTHORITY CHANGES & DASHBOARD RECALCULATION (LOCKED)

Whenever a user's authority chain changes (promotion, reassignment, reporting change):

* Access permissions must recalculate immediately
* Verification rights must update immediately
* Dashboard visibility must refresh immediately
* Team Management must maintain historical record of authority assignment changes

---

#### 10. CLIENT & VENDOR REPORTING AUTHORITY ASSIGNMENT (LOCKED GOVERNANCE RULE)

Even though Client/Vendor attendance schemas are separate later:

* Each Client must have **only one reporting authority** at a time
* Reassignment must be allowed later and must be recorded in Team Management

(Assignments of internal resources to Clients come later; Team Management is the governance hub.)

---

#### 11. VISUAL IDENTIFICATION (LOCKED)

Every attendance/punch/break/timeline event must show whether it was entered by:

* Self
* Manager
* Admin
* Super Admin

UI rule:

* Use distinct role markers (badge + initials/role label)
* This is in addition to audit logs

---

#### 12. APPROVALS & REQUESTS TRACKING — NEW REQUIRED DATA LAYER (LOCKED)

Edits requiring approval must generate records in a dedicated approvals system.

Minimum requirement:

* A dedicated tracking structure for:

  * Change request
  * Reason
  * Target record/day
  * Requested changes (diff)
  * Requested by (role/user)
  * Approved by (role/user)
  * Status: PENDING / APPROVED / REJECTED
  * Timestamps

Working naming options (lock later):

* Approval Center
* Change Control
* Authorization Log
* Governance Desk

---

#### 13. CURSOR DOCUMENTATION & DIAGRAM DUTIES (MANDATORY)

Cursor must append this instruction and generate documentation:

**Must update:**

* `INSTRUCTIONS_MASTER.md` → append Instruction #6
* `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` → add Team Management as governance layer of Work Time
* `PANEL_WISE_OVERVIEW/`:

  * super_admin_panel.md
  * admin_panel.md
  * manager_panel.md

**Must create flow docs (with diagrams):**

* `FLOWS_AND_DIAGRAMS/team_management_flows.md`

  * reporting hierarchy diagram
  * live supervision flows
  * punch self vs superior flows
  * multi-stage verification markers
  * edit lock window + approval flow
* `FLOWS_AND_DIAGRAMS/approval_change_control_flows.md`

  * request → approve/reject → apply diff → audit

All diagrams must be in Markdown/ASCII format and must align with the global expand/suppress UI pattern.

---

### 🔒 INSTRUCTION NUMBER 7 (WORK TIME REQUESTS + MY ACTIVITY + GOVERNANCE REINFORCEMENT)

**Date Recorded:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** ACTIVE - LOCKED

#### Work Time Requests + My Activity (Universal Activity Logs) + Governance Reinforcement

> This instruction **extends and tightens** the Work Time ecosystem and introduces a **universal accountability layer** via **My Activity (Activity Logs)**.

##### 2.7 Rejection Behavior

* Reason optional
* System must log:

  * Rejected by (name + role)
  * Rejected at (timestamp)
* Optional note allowed

##### 2.8 Effect on Work Time
